# BA775-project
Our goal is to analyze the inpatient expense of US medicare. We would like to explore the relations of covered rate, medicare charges, and total payments with regions, using visualization for medical charges and payments in different states from 2011 to 2017. We collect our data from CMS(Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services) official website. CMS is a federal agency within the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that administers the Medicare program and works in partnership with state governments to administer Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and health insurance portability standards. We are going to focus on analyzing the data 'Medicare Provider Utilization and Payment Data: Inpatient' from the year 2011 to 2017.
